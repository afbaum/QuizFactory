This is a c# console app that creates a quiz based on US States and their Capitals or Countries and their Capitals.  The program starts with a while loop which allows you to select 
    1. State Capital quiz
    2. Country Capital quiz
    3. quit

After you select the type of data for the quiz a new file is generated in the program directory called MyTest.txt.  This file will contain a multiple choise quiz based on the data you selected.  

Lessons learned.  I killed my program a couple of times by forgetting to type 3 to stop my while loop.  I understanding the basics of Git but still need more practice when it comes forks, branches and merging branches.

Current issues
    1. I could not find a csv file for Country Capital info so this list does not currently include all Countries and their Capitals
    2. I still need to work on the random genrator to make my answers more random, and to make sure they don't repeat.
